Assignment 1:
command line:
rails new ...
rails generate scaffold Make name:string country:string
rails generate scaffold Car make:string model:string VIN:string country:string make:references
rails generate scaffold Part part:string
rails generate model CarsParts car:references model:references --force-plural
rails db:migrate

changes made to models:
Make has many cars
car belongs to Make
car has and belongs to many Parts
part has and belongs to many cars

form changes:
added drop down form for car creation that references makes
added check box selection form for car creation that references Parts

the differences between scaffold and model
the meaning behind has_and_belongs_to_many, .. edit_car_path
